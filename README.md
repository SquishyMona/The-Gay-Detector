# The-Gay-Detector
Welcome to the Gay Detector(TM). This program will detect whether or not you are gay. This is a joke program lol I thought it would be a good meme.
If you are on Windows and you already compile and run C++ on your machine, the .exe file should work fine.
If you are on macOS or another Unix based OS, GayUnix should run fine on your system.
If none of those options work, you can go to https://onlinegdb.com/hQP_dQhGL and hit the green "Run" button at the top of the page to run the program.
